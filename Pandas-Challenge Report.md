The larger the school the lower the grades. the medium size schools have the best grades with smaller in close second with a big drop off of -30 points for the largest. Charter schools have overall better grades than District.

My findings shows the budgets of districts to charters appear to be closely related; charter to district with District having a slight edge which is suprising being that the grades are so poor in comparison to charter. I would like to see the teacher pay range. I am wondering if the teachers get paid more at the charter which is why the grase of the students are better. 

It appears that the lowest spending per student have the highest avg scores and overall passing rates. Also as spending increases there is a decrease in how the students fair in the curriculum.
